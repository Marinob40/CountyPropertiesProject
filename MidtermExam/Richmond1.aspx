        Impeccable all brick ranch in Hephzibah! This 4 bed, 2.5 bath is the perfect 
        place to call home. The brick exterior is elegant, modern, low maintenance, 
        and the landscaping is picture perfect. The kitchen is open and updated with granite, 
        stainless steel appliances, and a tile backsplash. The excessively large master bedroom 
        is a great place to relax in the seating area with a fireplace. The backyard comes with 
        a custom fire pit just in time for those fall and winter nights roasting marshmallows and 
        making memories! Schedule your private showing today and grab this steal before it's off 
        the market! It won't be on the available long. All information is deemed accurate but not 
        guaranteed.
